# AIMIAP Assignments

This repository contains my assignments for the course *Artificial Intelligence in Medical Image Processing and Analysis* at Sharif University of Technology. The assignments combine theoretical study and practical implementation of image processing, denoising, and segmentation methods for medical imaging.

## Homework 1 – Image Enhancement and Denoising
Covers a progression from basic image processing tasks to advanced denoising methods:
- **Image Operations**: mirroring, rotation, Fourier transforms, filtering, interpolation, and error metrics (MSE, MAE, PSNR).  
- **Classical Denoising**: Gaussian noise modeling with Total Variation (TV), BM3D, NLM, and WNNM.  
- **Deep Learning Approaches**: Noise2Clean, Noise2Noise, Self2Self, and CNN-based denoisers.  
- **Hybrid Methods**: Wavelet-based denoising extended with CNN architectures.

## Homework 2 – Image Segmentation
Focuses on clustering methods and deep learning approaches for medical image segmentation:
- **Theory**: Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM), DeepSVG, Fuzzy C-Means (FCM), and self-attention mechanisms.  
- **UNet and Variants**: Preprocessing, training, and evaluating UNet and Attention UNet on multimodal MRI data.  
- **Clustering Approaches**: K-Means, FCM, ResNet feature extraction, and SAM (Segment Anything Model).  
- **Deep Learning Models**: DeepSVG hybrids and DeepLabv3+ for medical image segmentation, evaluated with Dice, IoU, and accuracy.
